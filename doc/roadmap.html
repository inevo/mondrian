<h2><a name="2_Introduction">2 Introduction</a></h2>

<p>This is a list of features we propose to deliver in future releases of
Mondrian. Each feature is linked to a high-level description. Complex features
will have more detailed specifications in a separate document.</p>

<h3><a name="2.1_Purpose_of_this_document">2.1 Purpose of this document</a></h3>

<p>This document has several goals. First, it lets the Mondrian community know what 
features we are thinking about implementing. There may be better ways of 
delivering the same functionality that we haven't thought of.</p>

<p>Second, since there is always more work than time, it allows us to 
prioritize. If we hear that a particular feature is important to a lot of 
people, we will try to get to it sooner.</p>

<p>Third, it allows us to attract resources.&nbsp; If there are features in this 
roadmap which are important to your organization, consider sponsoring Mondrian's 
development. The extra </p>

<h3><a name="2.2_Mondrians_goals">2.2 Mondrian's goal</a></h3>

<p>Mondrian's goal is to bring multidimensional analysis to the masses.</p>

<p>To do this it needs to be:</p>
<ul>
	<li>free</li>
	<li>portable</li>
	<li>easy to install</li>
	<li>easy to integrate, and above all</li>
	<li>easy to understand</li>
</ul>

<p>As an open-source olap server written in pure Java, we feel that it meets 
these goals. We can't anticipate all of our customers' requirements, but 
open-source combined with Java keeps Mondrian flexible. It's easy to add 
functionality or to integrate third-party tools, and Mondrian be integrated into 
a variety of environments.</p>

<h3><a name="2.3_Scope">2.3 Scope</a></h3>

<p>Mondrian can't do everything. If it did everything, it would be a huge 
download, difficult to install, and even more difficult to integrate with other 
software; and we'd never finish writing it. But the good news is, this is open 
source. If a feature is missing, it's often easy to add the feature to Mondrian 
or to integrate with another open-source product that provides the feature.</p>

<p><a href="http://jpivot.sourceforge.net">JPivot</a> is Mondrian's sister project. 
It provides an excellent user-interface, and shows off what Mondrian 
can do. But we have been careful to keep the two projects separate. (You can use 
another user-interface to Mondrian, and you can also use JPivot with other 
data-sources.) If you've run Mondrian's demo and you have suggestions on how to 
improve the web interface, please
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=197389">make your 
suggestion to the JPivot project directly</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="2.4_Sponsored_development_and_co-development">2.4 Sponsored 
development and co-development</a></h3>

<p>Mondrian encourages companies to sponsor development of features which are 
important to them. Sponsorship allows Mondrian developers to spend more time to 
spend more time adding features to Mondrian, rather than having to find other 
ways to pay the rent. The results are always contributed back to the project as 
open-source.</p>

<p>Another way companies can help Mondrian is to assign employees to co-develop 
features. We can help specify and design these features, provided that the 
resulting code is contributed to the project.</p>

<p>If your organization would like to sponsor development of features, please 
contact Julian Hyde.</p>

<h2>3 Feature list</h2>

<h3><a name="3.1_Internationalization_localization">3.1 Internationalization/localization</a></h3>

<p><i>Effort: medium; importance: medium.</i></p>

<p>Mondrian's has limited support for internationalization and localization 
(I18N/L10N):</p>
<ul>
	<li>Every connection has a locale</li>
	<li>Messages are stored in localized resource files</li>
</ul>

<p>This feature adds:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Localized cube, dimension, hierarchy, level and measure names.</li>
	<li>Localized member names. For example, the member [Gender].[M] should have 
	the caption &quot;Male&quot; in English, &quot;Masculin&quot; in French.</li>
	<li>Localized format strings. Every locale has its own currency symbol, 
	thousands separator and decimal separator. In the en-US locale, these are 
	&quot;$&quot;, &quot;,&quot; and &quot;.&quot;.</li>
</ul>

<p>With this feature, we would also write a guide to I18N/L10N in Mondrian.</p>

<p>See the
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=6386685&forum_id=8760">
email thread &quot;MLS cubes RFC&quot;</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="3.2_Aggregate_navigation">3.2 Aggregate navigation</a></h3>

<p><i>Effort: high; importance: high.</i></p>

<p>Define aggregate tables in the schema.</p>

<p>Once the aggregate tables feature is stabilized, there are a number of extra
features we can build around it:

<p>1. Utility to populate (or generate INSERT statements to populate) the  agg
tables. (For extra credit: populate the tables in topological order, so that
higher level aggregations can be built from lower level aggregations.)

<p>2. Utility to generate a script containing CREATE TABLE and CREATE INDEX
statements all possible aggregate tables (including indexes), XML for these
tables, and comments indicating the estimated number of rows in these
tables. Clearly this will be a huge script, and it would be ridiculous to
create all of these tables. The person designing the schema could copy/paste
from this file to create their own schema.

<p>3. Utility (maybe graphical, maybe text-based) to recommend a set of
aggregate tables. This is essentially an optimization algorithm, and it is
described in the academic literature. Constraints on the optimization
process are the amount of storage required, the estimated time to populate
the agg tables. The algorithm could also take into account usage
information.

<p>4. Allow agg tables to be taken offline/online while Mondrian is still
running.

<p>I'm thinking of these being utilities, not part of the core runtime engine.
There's plenty of room to wrap these utilities in nice graphical interfaces,
make them smarter.

<h3><a name="3.3_Improved_cache_control">3.3 Improved cache control</a></h3>

<p><i>Effort: medium; importance: medium.</i></p>

<p>(to be specified)</p>

<h3><a name="3.4_WITH_SET">3.4 WITH SET</a></h3>

<p><i>Effort: medium; importance: high; priority: high.</i></p>

<p>Support the MDX <code>WITH SET</code> syntax.</p>

<h3>3.4.1 Store set definitions against cube</h3>

<h3><a name="3.5_Cache_set_expressions">3.5 Cache set expressions</a></h3>

<p><i>Effort: medium; importance: medium.</i></p>

<p>The WITH SET feature and functions such as RANK cause the same expression to 
be evaluated many times within the course of a single MDX statement. A 
set-expression cache will provide an order of magnitude performance improvement 
for such queries. </p>

<h3><a name="3.6_User-defined_functions">3.6 User-defined functions</a></h3>

<p><i>Effort: low; importance: medium; priority: medium.</i></p>

<p>A user-defined functions facility will allow an application developer to add 
MDX functions without modifying Mondrian's source code. To write a function, the 
developer will need to write a class which implements a given SPI 
(service-provider interface), include the class on the class-path, and reference 
the class from the schema file.</p>

<h3><a name="3.7_Improve_dimension_sharing">3.7 Improve dimension sharing</a></h3>

<p><i>Effort: high; importance: high; priority: medium.</i></p>

<p>Use the same dimension twice in the same cube.</p>

<h3><a name="3.8_Virtual_cube_enhancements">3.8 Virtual cube enhancements</a></h3>

<p><i>Effort: medium; importance: medium; priority: medium.</i></p>

<p>When a cube uses the same dimension twice is involved in a virtual cube, 
disambiguate which usage of the dimension is involved. Allow the virtual cube to 
use the same cube more than once.</p>

<h3><a name="3.9_Calculated_members_in_virtual_cubes">3.9 Calculated members in virtual cubes</a></h3>

<p><i>Effort: low; importance: medium; priority: medium.</i></p>

<p>One could imagine two levels: 1) simply access calculated measures from base 
cubes, 2) define new calculated measures spanning measures in the base cubes.</p>

<h3><a name="3.10_Time_function">3.10 Time function</a></h3>

<p><i>Effort: low; importance: medium; priority: medium.</i></p>

<p>See
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread_id=1222972&forum_id=111375">
the Open Discussion thread &quot;Accessing the current date in MDX&quot;</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="3.11_Scalar_functions">3.11 Scalar functions</a></h3>

<p><i>Effort: medium; importance: high; priority: medium.</i></p>

<p>Mondrian's set of functions for operating on numeric and string expressions 
is limited. This feature would add string manipulation functions (substring, 
trim, regular expressions) and arithmetic expressions (power, log, sqrt) and 
conversion functions (string to numeric, numeric to string).</p>

<h3><a name="3.12_Cold_start">3.12 Cold start</a></h3>

<p><i>Effort: medium; importance: medium; priority: low.</i></p>

<p>When Mondrian initializes and starts to process the first queries, it makes 
sql calls to get member lists and determine cardinality, and then to load 
segments into the cache. When Mondrian is closed and restarted, it has to do 
that work again. This can be a significant chunk of time depending on the cube 
size. For example in one test an 8GB cube (55M row fact table) took 15 minutes 
(mostly doing a group by) before it returned results from its first query, and 
absent any caching on the database server would take another 15 minutes if you 
closed it and reopened the application. Now, this cube was just one month of 
data; imagine the time if there was 5 years worth.<br>
<br>
What ideas and designs can you come up with to speed that up, in other words to 
do anything time consuming only once and reuse it between instances?</p>

<h3><a name="3.13_Rollups">3.13 Rollups</a></h3>

<p><i>Effort: medium; importance: medium; priority: low.</i></p>

<p>If the cache contains aggregates for all children of a member, then Mondrian 
would be able to compute the aggregate for the parent member by rolling up.</p>

<p>See the
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=6496831&forum_id=8760">
email thread &quot;grouper in Mondrian&quot;</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="3.14_Compound_slicer">3.14 Compound slicer</a></h3>

<p><i>Effort: medium; importance: low; priority: low.</i></p>

<h3><a name="3.15_Enhancements_to_schema_cache">3.15 Enhancements to schema cache</a></h3>

<p><i>Effort: low; importance: medium; priority: high.</i></p>

<p>At present, the schema is read from a URL when the connection is established. 
If the URL is of <code>http:</code> protocol, Mondrian assumes that the XML 
content of the schema file never changes, and therefore caches the schema 
definition in memory. But if the URL is of <code>file:</code> protocol, Mondrian 
assumes that the XML schema definition is volatile, and therefore it re-creates 
the schema every time a connection is established. This is expensive, and may 
the system's reponsiveness.</p>

<p>This feature adds a <code>cacheSchema</code> parameter to the connect string. 
Values are:</p>
<ul>
	<li><code>true</code>: Assume that the schema definition never changes.</li>
	<li><code>false</code>:&nbsp; Assume that the schema definition changes 
	frequently, and therefore rebuild the schema every time a connection is 
	established.</li>
	<li><code>digest</code>:&nbsp; Every time a connection is established, 
	re-read the schema, and compute a
	<a href="http://www.irnis.net/gloss/md5-digest.shtml">digest</a>. If the 
	digest is unchanged, assume that the schema is unchanged, and use the schema 
	definition from the cache.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="3.16_JOLAP_support">3.16 JOLAP support</a></h3>

<p><i>Effort: very high; importance: medium; priority: low.</i></p>

<p>Mondrian's support for the JOLAP API is currently incomplete. This feature 
would complete the implementation of the API.</p>

<h3><a name="3.17_Schema_and_query_validation">3.17 Schema and query validation</a></h3>

<p>Process to validate a schema.</p>

<p>PRocess to validate a set of queries. Maybe an option to ignore errors due to 
specific members not existing because the data hasn't been loaded yet.</p>

<p>Expose validation via Eclipse plugin.</p>

<h3><a name="3.18_Documentation">3.18 Documentation</a></h3>

<ul>
<li>Document 'ordinalColumn'</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="3.19_Name-resolution">3.19 Name-resolution</a></h3>

<p>Mondrian's name resolution is not always compatible with other MDX 
implementations such as MSAS and SAS.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Parameterize case-sensitivity: a connection parameter determines whether cube/dimension/hierarchy/level/member names are case-sensitive.</li>
	<li>Support abbreviated member names. For example, e.g. <code>[Products].[Boston Lager]</code> seems to be valid in MSAS if product names are unique, whereas Mondrian 
	currently requires <code>[Products].[Beverages].[Beer].[Samual Adams].[Boston Lager]</code>.</li>
	<li>Support keys in members, e.g. <code>[Products].#[1234]</code>.</li>
	<li>Alternative axis names. '<code>ON COLUMNS</code>' and '<code>ON AXES(0)</code>' 
	are supported, but '<code>ON 0</code>' is not.</li>
</ol>

<h3><a name="3.20_XMLA_interoperability">3.20 XML/A interoperability</a></h3>

<p>Get Excel working against Mondrian's XML/A interface. See posting
