I beat perforce into submission again so it would allow me to download a new copy of Mondrian and started to turn off Eclipse warnings so I could get a clean build. Here are the warnings I turned off, in case anybody else has to do this:

Assignment has no effect (e.g. 'x = x')
Non-static access to static member
Use of deprecated API
Local variable declaration hides another field or variable
Local variable is never read
Unused imports
Unused or unread private members
Malformed Javadoc comments
