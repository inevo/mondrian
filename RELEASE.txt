Mondrian 3.1.0.12477 production release notes
=============================================

Introduction
------------

Mondrian 3.1 is a minor release version of the leading
open-source OLAP engine. To find out more about mondrian, go
to http://mondrian.pentaho.org.

Mondrian-3.1.0.12477 is the first release candidate for
release Mondrian 3.1.

Contents
--------

As usual, there are two distributions for this release:
 * mondrian-<version>.zip contains the FoodMart dataset in
   SQL and Access format
 * mondrian-<version>-derby.zip contains the FoodMart
   dataset as an Apache Derby database

Each distribution contains the full mondrian source code, as
mondrian-<version>-src.zip, documentation including
generated API documentation, and a web archive mondrian.war.
This web archive contains all classes and libraries (jars)
necessary to run mondrian.

This release runs on Java version 1.5 and higher. For
backwards compatibility on Java 1.4, substitute
mondrian-jdk14.jar for mondrian.jar, and add
retroweaver-rt-1.2.4.jar to your classpath.

For further installation instructions, see
http://mondrian.pentaho.org/documentation/installation.php
or the included file doc/installation.html.

Main functionality in this release
----------------------------------

 - Tuple Aggregate Support
 - Database Dialecting Architecture. Database dialects are
   now pluggable, which means that they can be added to the
   classpath and Mondrian will use the most appropriate one.
 - Infobright Dialect Support
 - General performance improvements (SQL generation and
   sorting algorithms)
 - Allow SSAS2005-compatible syntax for resolving names
   of dimensions, hierarchies, levels, members, and in
   particular multiple hierarchies in a
 dimension. Since
   this is a minor release, we wish to avoid breaking
   changes, so this functionality is off by default. To
   enable, set mondrian.olap.SsasCompatibleNaming=true.

API changes in this release
---------------------------
 - High cardinality related array to list changes
 - Database dialect changes
 - AxisOrdinal changes. mondrian.olap.AxisOrdinal used to
   be an enum, is now an interface. Code that explicitly
   depends on this class will need to be recompiled.
 - Upgrade to olap4-0.9.7.145.
