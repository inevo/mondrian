Mondrian 2.3.2 release notes
============================

Mondrian-2.3.2 is the first production release of mondrian-2.3.

Main functionality in this release:

* Cache flushing.

* More efficient evaluation of queries which return large
  results. To achieve this, some MDX functions now have
  multiple implementations, and can return their results
  as iterators in addition to the usual list format.

* More control over queries which run for long periods of
  time, return large numbers of members or cells, or which
  use excessive amounts of memory. Under such conditions,
  queries throw particular a ResultLimitExceeded exception.

* JDK 1.5 is now the primary development and delivery
  platform. You can continue to run mondrian on JDK 1.4
  using the provided backwards-compatibility JARs created
  by retroweaver.

* Added support for Ingres and LucidDB (see
  http://docs.eigenbase.org/LucidDbOlap)

* JOLAP (JSR-069) support removed.

API changes which may impact existing applications:

* ResultLimitExceeded renamed to ResultLimitExceededException;

* Packages javax.olap, mondrian.jolap, org.omg.java.cwm
  removed;

* mondrian.olap.Axis: changed 'Position[] getPositions()'
  to 'List<Position> getPositions()';

* mondrian.olap.Position: methods 'Member get(int ordinal)'
  and 'int size()' (both inherited from List<Member>) replace
  data member 'Member[] members'.
