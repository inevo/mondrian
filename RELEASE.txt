=============================================

Introduction
------------

Mondrian 3.2.0.13583 is a minor release version of the leading
open-source OLAP engine. To find out more about mondrian, go

Contents

As usual, there are two distributions for this release:
 * mondrian-<version>.zip contains the FoodMart dataset in
   SQL and Access format
 * mondrian-<version>-derby.zip contains the FoodMart
   dataset as an Apache Derby database

Each distribution contains the full mondrian source code, as
mondrian-<version>-src.zip, documentation including
generated API documentation, and a web archive mondrian.war.
This web archive contains all classes and libraries (jars)
necessary to run mondrian.

This release runs on Java version 1.5 and higher. For
backwards compatibility on Java 1.4, substitute
mondrian-jdk14.jar for mondrian.jar, and add
retroweaver-rt-1.2.4.jar to your classpath.

For further installation instructions, see
http://mondrian.pentaho.org/documentation/installation.php
or the included file doc/installation.html.
