Mondrian 3.0.0.10550 release notes
==================================

Introduction
------------

mondrian-3.0.0.10550 is first milestone of the mondrian-3.0
release.

This release is beta quality code; major functionality is
complete, but there are significant known bugs and this
release should not be used for production applications.

This release will be followed by one or more 'release
candidate' releases, then a production release.



Contents
--------

As usual, there are two distributions for this release:
 * mondrian-<version>.zip contains the FoodMart dataset in
   SQL and Access format
 * mondrian-<version>-derby.zip contains the FoodMart
   dataset as an Apache Derby database

Each distribution contains the full mondrian source code, as
mondrian-<version>-src.zip, documentation including
generated API documentation, and a web archive mondrian.war.
This web archive contains all classes and libraries (jars)
necessary to run mondrian.

This release runs on Java version 1.5 and higher. For
backwards compatibility on Java 1.4, substitute
mondrian-jdk14.jar for mondrian.jar, and add
retroweaver-rt-1.2.4.jar to your classpath.

For further installation instructions, see
http://mondrian.pentaho.org/documentation/installation.php
or the included file doc/installation.html.

Main functionality in this release
----------------------------------

* Improved dimension sharing. Allow a shared dimension to be
  use used more than once within the same cube.

* Virtual cube enhancements. When a cube that uses the same
  dimension twice is involved in a virtual cube,
  disambiguate which usage of the dimension is involved.
  Allow the virtual cube to use the same cube more than
  once.

* olap4j API. olap4j is the Open Java API for OLAP
  (http://www.olap4j.org). From mondrian-3.0 onwards, olap4j
  is the main API for connecting to mondrian, browsing
  metadata and executing queries.

  Mondrian's previous API (classes in the mondrian.olap
  package) still exists but is deprecated; from mondrian-3.1
  onwards, classes and methods in this API may not exist,
  may not work, or may change.

* Scalar functions. Many scalar functions have been added in
  mondrian-3.0, to the the specification of the Visual Basic
  for Applications (VBA) and Excel libraries that are
  available by default in Microsoft SQL Server Analysis
  Services (SSAS) and that many MDX users assume are part of
  the core MDX language.

  Function list: Abs, Acosh, Asc, AscB, AscW, Asin, Asinh,
  Atan2, Atanh, Atn, Cache, CBool, CByte, CDate, CDbl, Chr,
  ChrB, ChrW, CInt, Cos, Cosh, Date, DateAdd, DateDiff,
  DatePart, DateSerial, DateValue, Day, DDB, Degrees,
  DrilldownLevel, DrilldownLevelBottom, DrilldownLevelTop,
  Exp, Fix, FormatCurrency, FormatDateTime, FormatNumber,
  FormatPercent, FV, Hex, Hour, InStrRev, Int, IPmt, IRR,
  IsDate, LCase, Log, Log10, LTrim, Minute, MIRR, Month,
  MonthName, Now, NPer, NPV, Oct, Percentile, Pi, Pmt,
  Power, PPmt, PV, Radians, Rate, Replace, Right, Round,
  RTrim, Second, Sgn, Sin, Sinh, SLN, Space, Sqr, SqrtPi,
  Str, StrComp, String, StrReverse, SYD, Tan, Tanh, Time,
  Timer, TimeSerial, TimeValue, Trim, TypeName, Val,
  Weekday, WeekdayName, Year.

  We have added additional forms to existing functions:
  Descendants(<Member>, , LEAVES); Format can now be applied
  to DateTime values; Iif can be applied to member, level,
  hierarchy, dimension and tuple and set values; Levels can
  be applied to a string expression.

* Aggregate roles. You can now define a role in the schema
  that has the sum of the privileges of two or more roles;
  and you can connect to mondrian with one or more roles.
  This facility enables closer integration with Pentaho
  access-control, where a user can already exist in multiple
  roles.

* Cell-level access-control. In mondrian-2.4, if access to a
  hierarchy is restricted, the value of a member is equal to
  the sum of its children; in mondrian-3.0, the
  HierarchyGrant element has a rollupPolicy attribute whose
  values are 'full', 'partial' or 'hidden'.

* JNDI in connect string. JDBC data sources can be specified
  by their JNDI name.

API changes in this release
---------------------------

* Removed various deprecated methods which used String or
  String[] to lookup multi-part identifiers. Methods:
   * Formula.Formula(String[], exp)
   * Formula.Formula(String[], Exp, MemberProperty[])

     MatchType)
   * Util.explode(String)
   * Util.lookupCompound(SchemaReader, OlapElement, String[],
     boolean, int)
   * Util.lookup(Query, String[])
